<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) in Defense and Security Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Remotely Operated Vehicle (Rov)</li><li>Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (Auv)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) play a crucial role in defense and security operations. There are two main types of UUVs - Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). ROVs are controlled by operators on the surface through a tether, allowing for real-time control and manipulation of objects underwater. AUVs operate independently, using pre-programmed instructions to navigate underwater environments, collect data, and complete tasks without human intervention. Both types of UUVs offer valuable capabilities in various defense and security applications.</p></p>
