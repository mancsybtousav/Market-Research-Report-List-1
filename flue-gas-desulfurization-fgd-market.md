<p><h1>Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Material, By Type, By End-user, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) is a technology used to remove sulfur dioxide from flue gases produced by combustion processes in power plants, industrial facilities, and other sources. The primary goal of FGD is to reduce air pollution and comply with environmental regulations by capturing and neutralizing sulfur emissions before they are released into the atmosphere.</p><p>The Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period. The growth of the market is driven by the increasing stringency of environmental regulations, resulting in a higher demand for FGD systems to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide. Additionally, the rising global focus on reducing air pollution and improving air quality is expected to further boost the adoption of FGD technologies.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Flue Gas Desulfurization market is the shift towards more advanced and efficient FGD technologies, such as wet scrubbers and dry scrubbers, which offer higher removal efficiency and lower operating costs compared to traditional FGD systems. Another emerging trend is the integration of FGD systems with other pollution control technologies, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, to achieve greater overall emissions reductions and operational efficiency.</p></p>
