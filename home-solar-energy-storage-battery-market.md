<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Home Solar Energy Storage Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Coupled Solar Battery</li><li>DC-Coupled Solar Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AC Coupled Solar Battery systems use a separate inverter to convert DC electricity from solar panels into AC electricity for household use. This type of system allows for more flexibility and efficiency in energy storage and distribution. On the other hand, DC Coupled Solar Battery systems store DC electricity directly from the solar panels without the need for additional conversions, making them simpler and potentially more cost-effective. Both types of systems offer benefits in terms of energy efficiency and independence from the grid.</p></p>
