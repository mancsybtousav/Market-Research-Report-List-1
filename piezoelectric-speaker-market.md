<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piezoelectric Speaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Piezo</li><li>Passive Piezo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piezoelectric speakers are categorized into two main types: active piezo and passive piezo. Active piezo speakers require an external power source to generate sound vibrations, making them suitable for high-power applications such as alarms and sirens. On the other hand, passive piezo speakers do not require an external power source as they generate sound vibrations in response to an external signal, making them ideal for low-power applications such as beepers and buzzers. Both types offer unique advantages depending on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
