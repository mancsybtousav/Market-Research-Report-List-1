<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ion Selective Permeation Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Per-Fluorinated</li><li>Non-Fluorinated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ion selective permeation resins can be classified into two main types based on their material composition: Per-Fluorinated and Non-Fluorinated. Per-Fluorinated resins are made using fluorinated polymers, which offer superior chemical resistance and durability. Non-Fluorinated resins, on the other hand, are composed of non-fluorinated polymers that are cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Both types of resins provide ion selective permeation capabilities, with Per-Fluorinated resins being more suitable for harsh chemical environments and Non-Fluorinated resins offering a more sustainable option.</p></p>
