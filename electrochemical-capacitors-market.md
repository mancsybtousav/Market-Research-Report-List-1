<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrochemical Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Layer Capacitor</li><li>Pseudocapacitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors, can be categorized into two main types: double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. Double layer capacitors store energy through the separation of charges at the interface between an electrolyte and an electrode material, providing high power density. Pseudocapacitors, on the other hand, store energy through reversible faradaic reactions, offering higher energy density compared to double layer capacitors. Both types of capacitors are widely used in various industries for their high power storage and fast energy delivery capabilities.</p></p>
