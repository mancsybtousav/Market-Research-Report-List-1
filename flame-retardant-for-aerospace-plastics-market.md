<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant for Aerospace Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Additive</li><li>Reactive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardants for aerospace plastics are classified into two main types: additive and reactive. Additive flame retardants are materials that are incorporated into the plastic during processing to provide fire resistance by physically blocking the spread of flames. On the other hand, reactive flame retardants chemically bond with the polymer matrix to form a protective char layer when exposed to fire. Both types of flame retardants play a crucial role in enhancing the safety and fire resistance of plastic components used in aerospace applications.</p></p>
