<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neutral-density Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reflective Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neutral-density filters are commonly classified into two market types: Non-Reflective Type and Reflective Type. Non-Reflective Type filters are designed to reduce the amount of light passing through without affecting color balance, making them ideal for long exposure photography. Reflective Type filters, on the other hand, are coated with reflective materials to bounce excess light away, resulting in reduced glare and improved contrast in high-contrast lighting conditions. Both types offer unique benefits for photographers looking to control exposure and achieve desired effects in their images.</p></p>
