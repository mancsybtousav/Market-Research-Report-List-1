<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bradycardia Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bradycardia Devices Market includes two main types of devices: pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Pacemakers are designed to regulate the heart's rhythm and electrical impulses, ensuring that it beats at a normal rate. On the other hand, ICDs are devices that can detect and treat dangerously fast heart rhythms by delivering electrical shocks to restore a normal heart rate. Both types of devices play a crucial role in managing bradycardia and ensuring proper heart function.</p></p>
