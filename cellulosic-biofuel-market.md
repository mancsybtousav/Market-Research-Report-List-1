<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulosic Biofuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Food Crops Fuel</li><li>Non-Food Crops Fuel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cellulosic biofuel market types include food crops fuel and non-food crops fuel. Food crops fuel primarily uses edible plants such as corn, wheat, and sugarcane to produce biofuels. This market type has been criticized for diverting food sources for fuel production, potentially causing food price increases and scarcity. On the other hand, non-food crops fuel utilizes non-edible plants like switchgrass and agricultural residues as feedstock for biofuel production, thus eliminating competition with food sources and offering a more sustainable alternative.</p></p>
