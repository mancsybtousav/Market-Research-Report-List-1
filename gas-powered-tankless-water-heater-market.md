<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas-powered Tankless Water Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Condensing</li><li>Non-Condensing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas-powered tankless water heaters come in two main types: condensing and non-condensing. Condensing tankless water heaters are more energy-efficient as they recapture and utilize heat from exhaust gases. This type is ideal for those looking to save on energy costs in the long run. Non-condensing tankless water heaters are generally more affordable upfront but are less efficient in terms of energy consumption. Both types offer on-demand hot water, making them a popular choice for many households.</p></p>
