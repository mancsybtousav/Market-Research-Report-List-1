<p><h1>Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market Size Furnishes Valuable Information Encompassing Market Share, Market Trends, and Projections Spanning from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents are a type of medical device used in the treatment of intracranial stenosis, or narrowing of the blood vessels in the brain. These stents are inserted into the affected blood vessel, expanded using a balloon catheter, and left in place to help keep the vessel open and maintain blood flow.</p><p>The Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to factors such as the rising prevalence of neurovascular diseases, technological advancements in stent design and materials, and increasing awareness about minimally invasive treatment options for intracranial stenosis.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market is the development of bioresorbable stents, which are designed to gradually dissolve in the body over time. These stents eliminate the need for long-term foreign material in the blood vessels, reducing the risk of complications such as restenosis and thrombosis.</p><p>Overall, the Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market is expected to continue growing as healthcare providers and patients increasingly turn to minimally invasive treatments for neurovascular diseases.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Stents</li><li>Closed-Loop Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon-expanded intracranial stents are used for treating intracranial aneurysms. There are two main types of balloon-expanded intracranial stents: open-loop stents and closed-loop stents. Open-loop stents have a single open-ended loop design that allows for better flexibility and conformability to the vessel walls. Closed-loop stents have a closed circular design that provides more radial support and stability. Both types of stents are used in endovascular procedures to improve blood flow and prevent aneurysm rupture in the brain.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Balloon-expanded Intracranial Stents Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ischemic Stroke</li><li>Hemorrhagic Stroke</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Balloon-expanded intracranial stents are used in the treatment of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. In the case of ischemic strokes, these stents are used to open up blocked blood vessels in the brain, restoring blood flow and preventing further damage. For hemorrhagic strokes, the stents help to reinforce weakened blood vessels, reducing the risk of rupture and subsequent bleeding. These stents play a crucial role in the management and treatment of both types of strokes, improving patient outcomes and reducing complications.</p></p>
