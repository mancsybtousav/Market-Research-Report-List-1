<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retinal Vein Occlusion Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Branch Retinal Artery Occlusion</li><li>Central Retinal Vein Occlusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retinal vein occlusion refers to the blockage of veins in the retina, causing vision problems and potential damage. There are two main types: branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). BRAO occurs when one of the smaller branches of the retinal artery becomes blocked, leading to limited blood supply to a specific area of the retina. CRVO, on the other hand, involves a blockage in the main vein that drains blood from the retina, affecting the entire retina and causing more severe symptoms.</p></p>
